**Material Text Field** for iOS is extended `UITextField` that has floating placeholder label to the top when a user begins to enter a text. Also the control is underlined at the bottom.

The control uses CoreGraphics affine transform for placeholder floating. Also overrides the `placeholder` property from `UITextField` that can be set directly from storyboard.

To use this control just place file in your project, drag standard `UITextField` on desired view controller and set the custom class `MaterialTextField` in storyboard identity inspector
